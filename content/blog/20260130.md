This release continues the stylistic shift that began with **ĦOLL** and **Live at Les Sens de Nyx**. There's now a stronger focus on electronics and structure, with a darker, colder overall approach. The ambient element is still present, of course, but it now functions more as a layer on top of everything else.

It's also the first time I've written an album specifically intended to be performed live. In the past, I always kept my live and studio work separate.

The album was written in 2025 between January and March, refined on tour in April, and recorded over the summer.

I really hope you'll like.
