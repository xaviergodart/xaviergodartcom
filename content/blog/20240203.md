Since its acquisition by [**Epic Games in 2022**](https://blog.bandcamp.com/2022/03/02/bandcamp-is-joining-epic/) and [**SongTradr in 2023**](https://blog.bandcamp.com/2023/11/22/songtradr-acquires-bandcamp/), followed by the lay off of 50% of its empoyees, there's been some incertainty about the future of [**Bandcamp**](https://bandcamp.com/).

Although nothing has changed on the platform yet, it's fair to say that the trust in its sustainability has declined.

And with that came lots of discussions on the independant artist depedance on **Bandcamp**, and the obvious lack of alternative platforms.

Fast-forward a few months, lets check what came out from these discussions. I'll only talk about drop-in **Bandcamp** replacement in terms of features:
 - *music player*
 - *free and pay-what-you-want downloads*
 - *subscriptions / patronage*
 - *direct-to-fan communication*
 - *catalog exploration*
 - *physical & merch sales*
 - *label functionality*
 - *fan page & collection*

Please note that these platform are still in heavy development and that their feature set will probably grow in the coming weeks or months.

## [mirlo](https://mirlo.space/)

<img src="/images/20240203/mirlo.png">

[**mirlo**](https://mirlo.space/) has been released recently and seems like they aim to clone what Bandcamp did, but with an emphasis on sustainability. Behind the platform is a [**worker co-op**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative), the project is open-source and available on [**github**](https://github.com/funmusicplace/mirlo/), and they follow a thing called [**Exit to Community**](https://blog.fracturedatlas.org/exit-to-community).

This is a concept I wasn't familiar with. In a nutshell, it's some kind of a mindset where the intent is to ensure that whatever the exit of the structure behind the service is, the community relying on it won't be impacted.

Artists need to open a Stripe account in order to receive payments, so standard Stripe fees will apply, in addition to some revenue share with mirlo according to their [terms](https://mirlo.space/pages/terms), but I can't find how much.

**Features**:
 - *music player*
 - *free and pay-what-you-want downloads*
 - *subscriptions / patronage*
 - *direct-to-fan communication (fan email collection + a simple blog on the artist page)*
 - *fan page & collection*

**Price**: Stripe fees per transaction + revenue share with mirlo

## [jam.coop](https://jam.coop)

<img src="/images/20240203/jamcoop.png">

Similar to mirlo, [**jam.coop**](https://jam.coop) is run by a co-op and is [open-source](https://github.com/freerange/jam-coop), and they seem to have similar [ethics](https://jam.coop/about).

Their roadmap indicates that they aims to match most Bandcamp features.

**Features**:
 - *music player*
 - *free and pay-what-you-want downloads*
 - *direct-to-fan communication (email)*

**Price**: Stripe fees per transaction, unsure about any other fees

## [artcore](https://artcore.com/)

<img src="/images/20240203/artcore.png">

Online since 2022, [**artcore**](https://artcore.com/) is the oldest entry on the list, and probably the richer in terms of features. Their catalog is the bigger too, and seems to be slightly oriented towards electronic music.

Contrary to the other platforms, they seem to operate more like a traditional company. It isn't open-source, and the revenue share is 20% (in addition to Paypal fees), which is 5% more than Bandcamp.

**Features**:
 - *music player*
 - *free and pay-what-you-want downloads*
 - *direct-to-fan communication*
 - *catalog exploration*
 - *label functionality*

**Price**: 20% revenue share + PayPal fees

## [Ampwall](https://ampwall.com/)

<img src="/images/20240203/ampwall.png">

[**Ampwall**](https://ampwall.com/) is not open to everyone yet, but it seems active and about to be released (they say early 2024). They seem to share [similar ethics](https://ampwall.com/#faq) with mirlo and jam.coop. They also seem to be the only one in the list to support physical and merchandising sells.

**Features** (from what the demo page shows for now):
 - *music player*
 - *free and pay-what-you-want downloads*
 - *physical & merch sales*

**Price**: Unknown yet

## Self-hosted alternatives

If you want to go the self-hosted way and get your hands dirty, here's a couple of solutions.

### [faircamp](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/)

[**faircamp**](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/) is a [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator), which means that you organise your music and content in a hierarchy of files, run the program, and you get a fully featured website, ready to upload on a web hosting provider.

It seems fairly easy to operate and is very well documented. You'll need an account on a payment platform in order to receive payment, but Faircamp doesn't force you to use of any specific one. The payment tunnel is actually pretty simple, as they don't enforce the payment from the user ([Soft Paycurtain](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/manual/downloads.html)). You just trust them to make the payment.

**Features**:
 - *music player*
 - *free and pay-what-you-want downloads*
 - *label functionality*

**Price**: Payment platform fees + hosting provider fees (but there's plenty of cheap options out there)

### [Rauversion](https://rauversion.com/)

[**Rauversion**](https://rauversion.com/) is a full-featured self-hosted Bandcamp alternative. It requires more technical skills to operate. But the platform offers lots of features that other don't, with social features and editorial contents to highlight the catalog or events/ticketing features.

The project doesn't look very active, but there's still some activity on the [github](https://github.com/rauversion/rauversion-ror) repository.

**Features**:
 - *music player*
 - *free and pay-what-you-want downloads*
 - *direct-to-fan communication (social features)*
 - *catalog exploration*
 - *label functionality*
 - *fan page & collection*

**Price**: Payment platform fees + hosting provider fees

## Conclusion

It's pretty awesome to see a few promising alternatives now, and more will probably come up this year. Right now, they seem to cover the basic features that made **Bandcamp** great.

But there's still a lot of work, and one problem that still needs to be solved is **discoverability**. One advantage of having a centralized platform that a lot of people use, is that it makes catalog exploration and search easy to do. In a post-Bandcamp era where there might be multiple platforms, they will need to [**federate**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)) in order to solve this problem.

An [**ActivityPub protocol**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub) integration could be one way. It's what [**Mastodon**](https://joinmastodon.org) uses for example.

Hopefully, we will see work in that direction in the near future.
