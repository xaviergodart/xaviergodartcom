We're proud to release the new LAVA album, Phase III, today on [Bandcamp](https://lavabdx.bandcamp.com/album/phase-iii).

LAVA is a collaboration between my good friend [Remi](https://yesdivulgation.bandcamp.com/) (synth guru) and myself (electric guitar).

We wrote and recorded it throughout 2021, and it's quite different from the previous releases as we wanted to make shorter and more focused tracks.
The overall mood is brighter than before, there's still the ambient and improvised aspects of the music, but also things that are more written than usual.

We hope you'll enjoy it. Please share if you like it!
