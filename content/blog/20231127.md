We're proud to release a new LAVA EP, Phase IV, today on [Bandcamp](https://lavabdx.bandcamp.com/album/phase-iv).

LAVA is a collaboration between my good friend [Remi](https://yesdivulgation.bandcamp.com/) (synth guru) and myself (electric guitar).

We wrote and recorded it throughout 2022 and 2023. Once again, we evolved, this time to a more written format, mixing our usual style with elements of electronics, doom metal and krautrock.
We hope you'll enjoy it. Please share if you like it!
