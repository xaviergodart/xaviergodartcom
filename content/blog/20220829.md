ĦOLL is now available on [Bandcamp](https://birtawil.bandcamp.com/album/oll).

It features 6 new tracks, that are all quite different, ranging from darkwave to noir jazz kind of sounds, while keeping the usual ambient feel. One common element to these tracks is the use of electronic beats and sounds.
That's the new thing, alongside the new writting approach, which is less improvisational and more track focused. And of course the addition of vocals.
It's a big departure from the previous albums, and I hope you'll enjoy it.
Please tell me what do you think, and share if you like it!
