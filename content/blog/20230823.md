I'll be giving a talk (in french) on my small experiments with making generative music with [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/) for the [playground #1 meetup](https://plgrnd.cc/).

The meetup will also fetaure talks and performances from [Julien Gachadoat (v3ga)](https://v3ga.net/) and [Tuxic](https://voidwork.space/).

It will happen in Bordeaux, at the Deezer's offices, on September 14th.
