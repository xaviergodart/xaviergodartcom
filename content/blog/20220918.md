You can now <a href="/birtawil">listen to Birtawil music on all major streaming platforms</a>.
Right now, only the last album, Ä¦OLL, is available. But I'll add the rest little by little.

I've been using Bandcamp exclusively until now, because it's the fairest model. But a few things made me change my mind:
- <a href="https://blog.bandcamp.com/2022/03/02/bandcamp-is-joining-epic/">Bandcamp has been bought by Epic Games</a>, and I'm not sure where this is heading. I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket anymore.
- Since 2022, <a href="https://get.bandcamp.help/hc/fr/articles/360007802494-What-about-taxes-">the IRS (US Tax) requires US based marketplaces like Bandcamp to issue tax forms to artists and labels who earn over $600 USD</a> in sales within one year (instead of $10,000 USD before). Again, not really sure where this is heading, but it's annoying at best, specially for very small projects like mines. I have a feeling that's why Bandcamp was sold, because they're not be able to make life easier for independant artists anymore. But I'm just speculating...
- It's 2022, and let's be honnest, most people are listening music through major streaming platforms.

In the future, I may also experiment with self-hosting my own music as an alternative.
