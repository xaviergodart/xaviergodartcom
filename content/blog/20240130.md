Since its acquisition by Epic Games in 2022 and SongTradr in 2023, there's been some doubt about the future of Bandcamp.
Although nothing has really changed on the platform (yet), it's fair to say than the trust in its sustainability has declined.

And with that came lots of discussions on the depedance of independant music on Bandcamp, and the obvious lack of alternatives.

Fast-forward a few months, lets check what came out from these discussions. I'll only talk about drop-in Bandcamp replacement in terms of features (online music hosting, music player, basic artist links and infos, free and pay-what-you-want downloads, merch etc...), and *not* on streaming platform alternatives like [resonate](https://resonate.coop/) for example.

mirlo has been released recently and seems like they aim to clone what bandcamp did, but with an emphasis on sustainability. Behind the platform is a [worker co-op](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative), the project is open-source and available on [github](https://github.com/funmusicplace/mirlo/), and they follow the [Exit to Community](https://blog.fracturedatlas.org/exit-to-community).

This is a concept I wasn't familiar with. In a nutshell, it's some kind of a mindset where the intent is to ensure that whatever the exit of the structure behind the service, the community relying on it won't be impacted. They are pretty much answer
