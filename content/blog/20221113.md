My last gig at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/5447004892051422/">Les Sens de Nyx</a> event in Bordeaux was captured by <a href="https://www.studiomatierenoire.com/">Studio Matière Noire</a>, huge thanks to them ♥

You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27fHYWE--7k">watch the whole performance on Youtube</a> or <a href="https://birtawil.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-les-sens-de-nyx">listen/download/buy it on Bandcamp</a>.

It features only new music. Material I write for my albums were never made with live performance in mind, so I tend to completely separate live music from album music.
Hope you'll enjoy! And please share if you like it!
