I'm a **software engineer** since 2009, with an appetence for **backend development** and a strong interest for **audio development**.

I build **performant** and **scalable** applications using **Golang**, **PHP** or **Python**. And I'm inclined to keep learning.

I enjoy thinking about **database schemas**, **caching strategies**, **async tasks** or managing **cloud infrastructure**.

I also have an good understanding on how audio softwares work. I played with **C++**, **JUCE** and **Faust** for **digital signal processing (dsp)** and **midi** applications and I'm inclined to learn more.

Here's an example of a generative ambience patch written in **Faust** and compiled to **WebAssembly**.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <button onclick="audioCtx.resume(); this.style.display = 'none'; this.nextElementSibling.style.display='inline';" style="width: 48px; height: 48px;">▶</button>
  <button onclick="audioCtx.suspend(); this.style.display = 'none'; this.previousElementSibling.style.display='inline'" style="width: 48px; height: 48px;display: none;">◼</button>
</p>

During my experience, I had to **lead tech teams up to 10 developers**, and I was keen to encourage **communication** and **sharing knowledge**.

I've been mainly working in the **music industry** for the last 10 years.
