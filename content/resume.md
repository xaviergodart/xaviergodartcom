I'm a **software engineer** since 2009, with a strong appetence for **backend development**.

I build **performant** and **scalable** applications using **Golang**, **PHP** or **Python**. And I'm inclined to keep learning.

I enjoy thinking about **database schemas**, **caching strategies**, **async tasks** or managing **cloud infrastructure**.

During my experience, I had to **lead tech teams up to 10 developers**, and I was keen to encourage **communication** and **sharing knowledge**.

I've been mainly working in the **music industry** for the last 10 years.
