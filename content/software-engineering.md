I'm a **software engineer** since 2009.

I create a collection of tools for making music in the command line under the name of [**emprcl**](https://empr.cl/).

I work on personal projects which are available on [**github**](https://github.com/xaviergodart).

## Runal

[**Runal**](https://empr.cl/runal/) is a text-based creative coding environment, that runs in the terminal.

It works similarly as processing or p5js but it does all the rendering as text. It can either be programmed with JavaScript, or used as a Go package.

## Signls

[**Signls**](https://empr.cl/signls/) is a non-linear, generative MIDI sequencer designed for music composition and live performances, all within the terminal.

## Sektron

[**Sektron**](https://empr.cl/sektron/) is a midi step sequencer, made with live performance in mind, that runs in the terminal (TUI).
