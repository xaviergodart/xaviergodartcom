In addition to being a musician, I'm also a **full-time software engineer** since 2009. I've been mainly working in the music industry for the last 10 years and I currently work at [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com).

You can find more about my professional endeavors on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xaviergodart/).

And I sometimes work on personal projects which are available on [github](https://github.com/xaviergodart).

I create a collection of tools for making music in the command line under the name of [emprcl](https://empr.cl/).
